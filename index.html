        <h2>Hi, I’m Prabhsharan.</h2>
        <p>I’m a Software Engineer driven by the challenge of solving real-world problems through innovative and scalable solutions.</p>
        <p>My passion for programming began during my undergraduate years, but it was during my first internship that I truly fell in love with the startup ecosystem and product development. Starting with frontend development, I quickly transitioned to full-stack engineering before finding my niche in backend systems. Currently, I’m a Founding Engineer at Jugyah, one of India’s fastest-growing technology-enabled residential brokerages.</p>
        <p>Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working with early-stage startups and collaborating closely with founders. This experience has shaped my product-focused approach to development, enabling me to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Evaluate how each feature contributes to the overall product vision and user experience.</li>
            <li>Develop solutions that deliver long-term value for both users and stakeholders.</li>
            <li>Design with scalability and flexibility in mind, ensuring the product evolves smoothly.</li>
            <li>Foster a collaborative environment that inspires and motivates fellow developers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When I’m not writing code or solving engineering challenges, I love exploring the world of philosophy and psychology, diving into how people think and what drives human behavior. I also have a deep appreciation for cinematography and storytelling, often analyzing films and TV shows for their narrative depth and visual artistry. In my downtime, I enjoy tinkering with hardware projects and automation, finding new ways to make life a little more efficient. And when I need a break from screens, you’ll likely find me outdoors, whether it’s on a road trip to new places or just unwinding with a good book under the open sky.</p>
