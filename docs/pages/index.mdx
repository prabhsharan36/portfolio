![Prabhsharan Singh Profile](https://ik.imagekit.io/qu20t6lqgz/IMG_20230825_102544258~3%20(1).jpg?updatedAt=1741377929032 "Prabhsharan Singh Profile")

Hi, I’m Prabhsharan.

I’m a Software Engineer passionate about building impactful solutions and learning through the process.

I discovered my love for programing during my undergraduate years and developed a passion for startups and building products during my first internship. I began with frontend development, transitioned to fullstack, and now focus primarily on backend development. Currently, I’m a Founding Engineer at Jugyah,  India’s fastest growing technology enabled residential brokerage.

Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working with early-stage startups and collaborating closely with founders. This experience has shaped my product-focused approach to development, enabling me to:

- Consider the broader product-wide impacts of features.
- Design solutions that create net-positive outcomes for all stakeholders.
- Anticipate and plan for feature scalability and extensibility.
- Keep my fellow developers and mentees excited about the work we’re doing.

When I’m not coding, I’m usually learning about the philosophies of the greatest minds and practicing self-control. I’m also deeply interested in personal finance, health, and music. On the side, I’m a noob barista, experimenting with brewing the perfect cup of coffee. You can often find me obsessing over something new and fascinating.
